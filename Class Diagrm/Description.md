<h2>What is a Class Diagram?</h2>

The class diagram is a type of map: It’s a System snapshot from a high point of view. The chart aims to represent a specific system in the most direct and forward way, where the Actors of the system and their operations are located in the center of the diagram. (Actor: an active, autonomous entity that aims at achieving its goals by exercising its know-how, in collaboration with other actors)
